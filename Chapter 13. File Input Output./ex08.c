// Write a program that takes as command-line arguments a character and zero or more
// filenames. If no arguments follow the character, have the program read the standard
// input. Otherwise, have it open each file in turn and report how many times the character
// appears in each file. The filename and the character itself should be reported along with
// the count. Include error-checking to see whether the number of arguments is correct and
// whether the files can be opened. If a file canâ€™t be opened, have the program report that
// fact and go on to the next file.
