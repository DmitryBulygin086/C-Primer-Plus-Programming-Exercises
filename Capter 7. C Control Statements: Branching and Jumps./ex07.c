// Write a program that requests the hours worked in a week and then prints the gross pay,
// the taxes, and the net pay. Assume the following:
//      a. Basic pay rate = $10.00/hr
//      b. Overtime (in excess of 40 hours) = time and a half
//      c. Tax rate:    15% of the first $300
//                      20% of the next $150
//                      25% of the rest
// Use #define constants, and donâ€™t worry if the example does not conform to current
// tax law.
